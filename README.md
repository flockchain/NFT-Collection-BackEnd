Hello visitor,

this is the Back-End for my NFT-Collection. It's written in Solidity and build with the hardhat-framework.
You can find the related Front-End in my repositorys.

Before you can see the informations about the Smart-Contract on the Webpage, you need to sign-in with your MetaMask account, and connect the goerli testnet.

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
